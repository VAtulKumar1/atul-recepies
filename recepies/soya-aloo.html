    <img src="https://ukchilliqueen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Soya-Aloo-1024x1019.jpg">
    <p>Potatoes cooked with fresh Dill in a thick and fragrant sauce with a slight chilli kick.</p>
    <p>A very simple, quick, and moreish dish with a beautiful aroma.

        One of my dad’s favourites and probably one of the very first few dishes I picked up from him.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Potatoes - 4 or 5 (thinly sliced)</li>
        <li>Tomatoes – 2 (roughly chopped)</li>
        <li>Green chillies – 3 (roughly chopped)</li>
        <li>Cumin seeds – 1 tbsp</li>
        <li>Mustard seeds – 1/2 tbsp</li>
        <li>Dried round red chillies – 3 or 4</li>
        <li>Salt – 1 tsp (or to taste)</li>
        <li>Dried red chilli flakes – 1 tsp</li>
        <li>Turmeric powder – 1 tsp</li>
        <li>Green chillies – 3 (finely sliced)</li>
        <li>Fresh Soya (Dill) leaves – one bunch (roughly chopped)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the potatoes, tomatoes, and the 3 roughly chopped green chillies together with a little salt until potatoes are soft. Drain and set aside</li>
        <li>Heat up a little mustard (or vegetable) oil, add cumin and mustard seeds, and dried round red chillies. Wait for them to crackle before adding salt, chilli flakes, and turmeric powder. Fry for a minute until fragrant. *See note below</li>
        <li>Add 3 finely sliced green chillies and the soya leaves and when they turn a darker green colour (less than 5 minutes), add the set aside boiled potatoes, tomatoes, and green chillies. Stir/toss gently (careful not to break the potatoes too much) to coat and then cover and simmer for a few minutes on low heat</li>
    </ol>
